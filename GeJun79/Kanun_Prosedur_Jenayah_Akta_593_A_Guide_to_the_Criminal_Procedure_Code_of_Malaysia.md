The Criminal Procedure Code was enacted in 1935 as Ordinance No. 6 of 1935. It was based on the Indian Criminal Procedure Code of 1898, which in turn was derived from the English common law system. The Code has been amended several times over the years to keep up with the changes in society and the legal system. The most recent amendment was made in 2012 by Act A1434.
 
The Criminal Procedure Code is divided into five parts: Part I (Preliminary), Part II (Provisions as to Criminal Courts), Part III (General Provisions), Part IV (Arrest, Escape and Retaking), and Part V (Processes to Compel Appearance). Each part contains several chapters and sections that deal with specific topics and issues. The Code also has two schedules: Schedule I (Forms) and Schedule II (Enactments Repealed).

The Criminal Procedure Code is an important source of law for anyone who is involved or interested in criminal cases in Malaysia. It provides a comprehensive and clear framework for the administration of criminal justice in accordance with the principles of fairness, justice and human rights.
  
The Criminal Procedure Code applies to all criminal cases in Malaysia, regardless of whether the offence is committed under the Penal Code or any other law. However, there are some exceptions and modifications for certain offences or situations, such as offences against the security of the state, offences under Islamic law, offences committed by juveniles, and offences committed by members of the armed forces. In such cases, there may be special laws or procedures that supplement or override the provisions of the Code.
 
The Criminal Procedure Code also recognizes the role and powers of the Attorney General as the public prosecutor and the chief legal officer of the Federation. The Attorney General has the control and direction of all criminal prosecutions and proceedings under the Code. He has the discretion to institute, conduct or discontinue any criminal proceedings, subject to certain constitutional limitations. He also has the power to issue general or specific directions to any public officer or police officer on matters relating to criminal investigations or prosecutions.
 
The Criminal Procedure Code provides for various types of criminal courts that have different levels of jurisdiction and powers. The highest criminal court is the High Court, which has unlimited original jurisdiction over all criminal matters and appellate jurisdiction over decisions of subordinate courts. The subordinate courts consist of Sessions Courts and Magistrates' Courts, which have limited original jurisdiction over certain classes of offences and sentences. There are also special courts for certain categories of persons or cases, such as Juvenile Courts, Penghulu's Courts, Syariah Courts and Court Martial.
